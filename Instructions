In Activity #09 you submitted an Rmarkdown file (RMD) that combined several of your concepts that you've learned this term. Now you'll go back to that file and change it so that it will be more reproducible. That is, so that another user, or even yourself in the future, will have an easier time understanding and using it. We've discussed the following methods for improving reproducibility.

    Create an R Studio project that contains just this RMD file and your data.
    Create a GitHub repo for this assignment.
    Install and use {groundhog} to load packages from a set date. Use the date that you started working on this RMD. (You can see what happens if you change this date, and how dates in the past may break your code.)
    Load data using a relative file path.
    Include at least one comment for each code chunk explaining why it was included
    Give each object you create a meaningful name.
    Create a Code Appendix which shows all of your code at the end of the knitted file. (You should use echo = FALSE in either as the default option or as a code chunk option in each chunk.)
    Include a screenshot of your file directory to show that you have successfully created a project and worked within it and include a link to your GitHub Repo (make sure the repo is public).
    Change your RMD to have these features and then resubmit the knitted file.

You might find the following example chunks helpful.

```{r loadPackages}
#Load packages with groundhog to improve stability
library("groundhog")
pkgs <- c("firstpackage", "secondpackage", "thirdpackage")
groundhog.library(pkgs, '2023-01-01') #Use the date that you started the project here
```

\newpage
# Code Appendix
``` {r codeAppedix}
#| ref.label = knitr::all_labels(),
#| echo = TRUE,
#| eval = FALSE
```
